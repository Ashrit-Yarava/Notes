### Proving the relevance of SBFL
Before getting started on the actual topic of the paper, it is important to demonstrate that SBFL is still relevant. The collection of papers below aim to build credence that SBFL research is still present and could be worked upon. These papers target a variety of fields, from identifying that SBFL is used in other papers, to identifying new research done in SBFL. The selected papers below are all from known software engineering journals.

The following papers all explore the use of the use of SBFL in new contexts:
[[Coverage-Based Fault Localization in Haskell]] - ASE

The following papers aim to improve coverage based fault localization strategies with incorporating additional information:
[[Improving fault localization with pre-training]] - Frontiers in Computer Science
[[Semantic context based coincidental correct test cases detection for fault localization]] - ASE
[[Model Checking-Enhanced Spectrum-Based Fault Localization]] - Conference on Computing Systems and Applications
[[New Ranking Formulas to Improve Spectrum Based Fault Localization Via Systematic Search]] - Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation
[[On The Efficiency Of Combination Of Program Slicing and Spectrum-Based Fault Localization]] - Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation


The following papers, while not directly related to fault localization, demonstrate that SBFL is still used:
[[You Cannot Fix What You Cannot Find! An Investigation of Fault Localization Bias in Benchmarking Automated Program Repair Systems]] - Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation
-> Shows how a lot of the papers make use of SBFL. This is an analysis of the APR tools and demonstrates that *Ochiai* is almost ubiquitously used compared to other algorithms in APR pipelines.
