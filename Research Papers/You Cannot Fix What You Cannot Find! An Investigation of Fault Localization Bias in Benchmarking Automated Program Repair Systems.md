The authors analyze the impact of fault localization on APR tools. The authors find that a large portion of APR papers make use of the SBFL-Ochiai algorithm as a means of fault localization as it is quick and efficient. However, authors note that this provides an inherent limitation to the algorithm as non-localized bugs cannot be solved.

They also identify that differences between the algortihm's version (GZoltar versions) have differing results leading to differences in performance that might not be accounted for in the algorithm.
