The authors argue that the use of a chain-of-thought style prompting algorithm can be used with LLMs to generate explanations for fault localization results. The authors provide the following information to the LLM:
- Faulty code
- Task Description
- Test Results
- SBFL results
The authors find that of the 30 examples they took, the authors were able to find that the generated examples generally tend to match. And the use of the LLM for generating explanations found better results compared to the SBFL algorithms.
