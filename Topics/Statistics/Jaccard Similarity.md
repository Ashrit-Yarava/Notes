Jaccard Similarity is a way of measuring the similarity between two sets of elements. The formula is defined as:
$$
J(A, B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
$$
In other words, it can be defined as the percentage of the intersection divided by the union of two sets. For a large list of data, this can be used to represent in the form of a symmetrical matrix to identify the overlap between individual pairs of elements.
