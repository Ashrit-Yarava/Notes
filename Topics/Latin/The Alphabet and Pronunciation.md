#latin 
The roman alphabet is similar to English but does not have the letters *j* and *w*. The letter *u* also did not exist until the very end when *v* was split from the vowel and consonant sound. *k* is rarely used and only occurs before *a* in very few words. The letters *y* and *z* were added toward the end of the [[History of Latin Literature and Language#Late Republican and Augustan Period|Republic]].
## Vowels
Vowels in latin have two forms: *long* and *short*. Long vowels are generally spoken with twice the length of the short vowels. The bar over a vowel (ā (typed with alt + a)) is used to denote a long vowel. The differences between the letters is crucial as it changes the meaning of the word. Other ways to write the long form involve doubling the vowel (līber vs. liiber).

Vowels that are normally long are shorted when they occur immediately before another vowel. This is done as the lengths of the vowels become nonsensical, as seen in [[Verbs#Infinitives]] use of **moneō**.
## Diphthongs
Latin makes use of diphthongs, combinations of two vowel sounds that collapse together into a syllable: *ae*, *au*, *ei*, *eu*, *oe*, *ui*.
## Syllables
Latin syllables are clearly defined, with the number of syllables in a word equalling the number of vowels and diphthongs it has. The rules are as follows:
- Two continuous vowels or a vowel and a diphthong are seperated: dea => de-a.
- A single consonant between two vowels goes with the second vowel: amīcus => a-mī-cus.
- Two or more consonants between two vowels, usually the last consonant goes with the second vowel. mittō => mit-tō.
- A stop letter (p, b, t, d, c, g) or a liquid (l, r) count as a single consonant and go with the following vowel. Other pairs considered single consonants are: ch, ph, th (known as *aspirates*).
	- patrem => pa-trem
	- castra => cas-tra
	- architectus => ar-chi-tec-tus
Syllables can also be long if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong. It is also considered long if it contains a short vowel followed by two or more consonants or by *x* (considered a double consonant: ks).
* <u>lau-dō</u>, <u>ser</u>-vat
Syllables are very important in latin poetry and also determined the location of the *stress accents*.
### Stress Accent
The location of the stress accent, which is used to emphasize a specific syllable has specific rules:
- In a word of two syllables, the accent always falls on the first syllable.
- In a word with three or more syllables:
	- The accent falls on the next to last syllable (*penult*) if the syllable is long (ser-vā'-re).
	- Otherwise, the accent falls on the symmable before that (*antepenult*): mo'-ne-ō.
## Latin Pronunciation
The words in latin match their vocabulary rules, and is very easy to speak as long as the rules regarding syllables are followed.

## Word Order
The typical word order in Latin is:
1. The subject and its modifiers.
2. The indirect object and modifiers.
3. Direct object and modifiers.
4. Adverbial words or phrases.
5. Verb
While these rules are usually followed, word emphasis can allow for modification of the location of the word. Due to latin being a highly inflected language, there is considerable freedom of choice in word ordering, unlike English. The starting or ending of a sentence have the most emphasis placed on it. Examples shown below indicate the nature of the word order:

The boy is giving the pretty girl a rose.
- **Puer puellae bellae rosam dat.**
- **Bellae puellae puer rosam dat.**
- **Bellae puellae rosam dat puer.**
- **Rosam puer puellae bellae dat.**

In the above examples, they all mean the same thing, but due to inflection, they can be arranged in whatever manner.
