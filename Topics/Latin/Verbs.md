#latin 
Like English, Latin verbs exhibit the 5 characteristics:
- **Person**: Who is the subject? Who performs the action? 1st person, 2nd person, 3rd person POV.
- **Number**: How many subjects (singular or plural)?
- **Tense**: The time of the action. Latin has 6 tenses: *present*, *future*, *imperfect*, *perfect*, *future perfect*, *pluperfect*
- **Mood**: The manner of the action, indicating the state of being of the verb. There are three forms:
	- *Indicative*: Indicating facts
	- *Imperative*: Ordering actions
	- *Subjunctive*: Hypothetical or potential actions
- **Voice**: Whether the subject performs the action or receives the action.
## Conjugation
To **conjugate** a *finite verb* is to list all of its forms and variations based on changes in the above characteristics. In english, these forms have prepositions that change the person. Latin however, does not need these as it makes use of [[#Personal Endings]].
## Personal Endings
Latin makes use of different suffixes to generate meaning for words. The suffixes for active voice are:

| **Singular**               |          |
| -------------------------- | -------- |
| 1st person (I ...)         | -ō or -m |
| 2nd person (you ...)       | -s       |
| 3rd person (he/she/it ...) | -t       |
| **Plural**                 |          |
| 1st person (we ...)        | -mus     |
| 2nd person (you (pl.) ...) | -tis     |
| 3rd person (they ...)      | -nt      |
By prepending different verb stems, you can generate sentences. Note that verb endings must agree with the noun endings (related to objects it acts upon).

The imperative mood (commanding) is done through the addition of adding *-te* to the stem. Example:
- 2nd person singular: **laudā** (praise!)
- 2nd person plural: **laudāte** (praise! (asking multiple people))
## Infinitives
A common verbal form that is comparable to the equivalent of saying "to ...". These words end with *-āre* or *-ēre*. Example words are **laudāre** (to praise) and **monēre** (to advise). The *ā* signifies the first conjugation and *-ē* signifies the second conjugation. To apply the [[#Personal Endings]], drop the *-re* and append the given text.
- **laudāre** => **laudā** => **laudāt** (translates to: he praises)
Note that there are exceptions to the rules above, for example:
- **laudāre** => **laudā** => **laudō** (translates to: I praise)

The present indicative active of **moneō**:

| **Singular**               |              |
| -------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1st person (I ...)         | **moneō**    |
| 2nd person (you ...)       | **monēs**    |
| 3rd person (he/she/it ...) | **monēt**    |
| **Plural**                 |              |
| 1st person (we ...)        | **monēʻmus** |
| 2nd person (you (pl.) ...) | **monēʻtis** |
| 3rd person (they ...)      | **moʻnent**  |
Note the use of the [[The Alphabet and Pronunciation#Stress Accent]] above. Usually however, they are excluded. Additionally, the meaning can change based on context. For example, **mē laudant** (they praise me) has:
- they praise me (simple present)
- they are praising me (progressive present)
- they do praise me (emphatic present)
