## Predicate Nouns and Adjectives
Since words such as **sum** primarily serve to connect the word with other words, they cause the predicates (the verb and all its modifiers including the indirect subjects). As such, the predicate nouns and adjectives must whenever possible also agree with the subject noun's gender and tense. Example sentences are given below:

**Vergilius est amīcus Augustī.** => Vergil is the friend of Augustus.
**Puerī dēbent esse bonī.** => The boys ought to be good.
**Puer et puella sunt bonī.** => The boy and girl are good.
## Substantive Adjectives
Phrases such as "the meek shall inherit the Earth" have the implied noun, *people* that is abstained from the sentence. Similarily, in Latin, the noun can be removed, however, the [[#Predicate Nouns and Adjectives]], must still agree with the not stated noun. Examples are given below.

**Bonās saepe laudant.** => They often praise the good *women*.
**Multī sunt stultī.** => Many *men* are foolish.

## **Possum** (to be able, can, could)
The verb, **possum**, is derived from the adjective, **potis** (able, capable of). The verb conjugations can be formed through taking the stem *pot-* / *pos-* and adding the associated verb ending from **sum**. Note that *pos-* is only used when the sum personal ending starts with s.

Similar to *sum*, *possum* is an infinitive and requires another verb to complete its meaning. Their tenses must agree with each other.
