## Archaic through Early Republican Period
The roman culture during this time was extremely weak, and much of the influence is gained from the Greek culture, which at the time was a bastion of culture, with plays, comedies, and philosophical ideas. The most famous works of this time are *Plautus* and *Terence*. These works would later inspire famous playwrights such as Shakespeare.
## Late Republican and Augustan Period
(80 B.C. - A.D. 14)
This period was the last years before the fall of the Roman Empire and the birth of Christianity. The writers of this era perfected the language and made it so that it lasted thirteen centuries after the fall of the empire. Some famous authors include:
- *Lucretius*: Author of *De Rerum Natura*, which argued for forgetting the tyranny and fear of the gods and that the world was natural and not of the divine.
- *Catullus*: A lyrical poet.
- *Cicero*: The greatest roman orator, who's words overthrew the bankrupt aristocrat Catiline. He is considered an authority on Roman rhetoric. He spread Greek philosophical ideas to the Roman culture. His contributions to the Latin language make the language what it is today.
- *Caesar*: Wrote a lot of military memoirs.
- *Nepos*: Friend of *Catullus* and *Cicero* and a writer of biographies that had a easy to read and popular style.
- *Publilius Syrus*: Famous for his mimes and is today known for a collection of epi-grammatic sayings.
The Augustan Period is defined by Emperor Augustus and his use of literature as a means of developing stability and trust in the Roman government. He and Maecenas worked toward this goal by employing artists, known as poet laureates:
- *Vergil*: Considered a "master of language," he wrote one of the most famous epics, *the Aeneid*.
- *Horace*: Wrote a lot of satires.
- *Livy*: Friend of Augustus but also an admirer of the old republic (before Caesar).
- *Propertius*: Author of four books of romantic elgaiac poems.
- *Ovid*: Author of several volumes of love poetry. Most known for his mythological work, *Metamorphoses*.
## The Post-Augustan Period
This era was classified by a large number of works that strived for passion and effects with less focus on literary sense.
- *Seneca*: Stoic philosopher from Spain, wrote moral essays, tragedies, and *Apocolocyntosis* (death and deification of Emperor Claudius).
- *Petronius*: Neronian consular and coutier. Wrote *Satyricon*.
- *Quintilian*: teacher and author of *Institutio Oratoria*.
- *Martial*: 1,500 witty epigrams.
- *Pliny the Younger*: Best known for *Epistulae*.
- *Tacitus*: Satirical, pro-senatorial historian.
- *Juvenal*: Rhetorical satirist of the evils of his times. "mens sana in corpore sano" (sane mind in a sane body).
## The Patristic Period
The rise of Christianity led to Christian leaders (*patres*) playing a large part in the literature. The literature was aimed toward the common people with the goal of conversion, and as such was a return to the vulgar latin found in [[#Archaic through Early Republican Period]] with a lot of influence from Cicero.
## The Medieval Period
This marked the numerous changes that took place, with the removal of declensions and the increased use of prepositions - no longer being called Latin. However, Latin was still used by the Church.
