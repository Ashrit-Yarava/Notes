The second declension follows the same rules outlined in [[First Declension Nouns and Adjectives#First Declension]] but with different endings. Unlike the first declension, most of the words in the second declension are masculine. Most of them have the nominative singular ending of *-us* while a few of them end in *-er*. Examples for **amīcus** (friend) are shown below:

| **Singular** | **Endings** | **Example** |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative   | *-us*       | amīcus      |
| Genitive     | *-ī*        | amīcī       |
| Dative       | *-ō*        | amīcō       |
| Accusative   | *-um*       | amīcum      |
| Ablative     | *-ō*        | amīcō       |
| Vocative     | *-e*        | amīce       |
|              |             |             |
| **Plural**   |             |             |
| Nominative   | *-ī*        | amīcī       |
| Genitive     | *-ōrum*     | amīcōrum    |
| Dative       | *-īs*       | amīcīs      |
| Accusative   | *-ōs*       | amīcōs      |
| Ablative     | *-īs*       | amīcīs      |
| Vocative     | *-ī*        | amīcī       |
Note that there are special cases such as **ager** (field) that change the stem to **agr-** rather than **age**.
## Apposition
An *apposite* is a noun that is added next to another noun to add meaning to the noun. The noun must agree with the case of the noun is apposites. It can be thought of as adding extra information to the noun in the sentence.
**Gāium, fīlium meum, in agrō videō.** => I see Gaius, my son, in the field.
