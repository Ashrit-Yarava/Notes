There are two primary types of nouns: commons nouns which describe something/someone generally and proper nouns which are more specific (names). Nouns can also be abstract (not physical) or concrete.

1. The poet is giving the girl large roses.
2. The girls are giving the poet's roses to the sailors.
3. Without money the girls' country (or the country of the girls) is not strong.

*Nominative case* is commonly used to describe the subject of a finite verb. The subject is the one that is doing the action indicated by the verb. In (1), the poet is consiered the nominative case.

*Genetive case* is the noun that the subject/verb indirectly act upon. It is the indirect subject. It can be commonly thought of as in possession of the object that is being acted upon. A noun in the genetive case follows the noun in modifies. In (2), the poet would be the genetive case.

*Dative case* refers to the noun that is indirectly affected by the action of the verb. In (2), the sailors are the dative case.

*Accusative case*: The direct object upon which the verb acts upon. In (1) and (2), the roses are the accusative case.

*Ablative case* is the case used for words to modify, or limit the verb through ideas such as *means* (by/with what), *agent* (by whom), *accompaniment* (with whom), *manner* (how), *place* (where/from which), and *time* (when).

*Vocative case* used to address on call on the person/thing directly. Example: **Salvē, nauta** (Greetings, sailor.)
## First Declension
Listing all the forms the noun can take as listed above is called a *declension*. Similar to how [[Verbs#Conjugation]] takes place to modify the verb to fit the sentence, suffixes are added to the root of the noun to modify the case. The example below uses the word **porta** (gate) with the root form of the noun being **port**

| **Singular** | **Endings** | **Example** | **Plural** | **Endings** | **Example** |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative   | *-a*        | porta       | ...        | *-ae*       | portae      |
| Genetive     | *-ae*       | portae      | ...        | *-ārum*     | portārum    |
| Dative       | *-ae*       | portae      | ...        | *-īs*       | portīs      |
| Accusative   | *-am*       | portam      | ...        | *-ās*       | portās      |
| Ablative     | *-ā*        | portā       | ...        | *–īs*       | portīs      |
| Vocative     | *-a*        | porta       | ...        | *-ae*       | portae      |
## Gender
Like English and other languages that derive from Latin, nouns have gender (masculine, feminine, and neutral (*neuter*)). ==Most first declension nouns are feminine==. Few nouns such as **poetā** were masculine.
## Adjectives
Note that adjectives share the same declension. For example, the phrase "the large gate" is **porta magna** (note the same ending). Adjectives share the same case as the noun they act upon. Adjectives that are used this way are called *attribute adjectives*. Since adjectives share the noun's tense, they can be positioned in different orderings. This allows for emphasis and changing the tone of the language, in a way that is not possible in English.
